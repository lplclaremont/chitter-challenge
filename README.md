Chitter Challenge
=================
# chitter-challenge

A twitter clone, my first complete web application as part of Makers Academy. It contains users who are able to make posts. A sign up form to create a new user and start making posts. This was a challenging and enjoyable project. I have implemented tagging functionality with posts so users can tag other users (with `@username`) which appears as a link to that user page.
The most difficult part was implementing a login feature which I have done manually. Once logged in, the user's homepage is redirected to a specific page where only they are able to make posts.
I am going to look into how to encrypt using Bcrypt

## How to use

```shell
bundle install
rackup
```

## Built with
- Ruby
- Rspec
- Sinatra
- PostgreSQL

## Still to add
- Bcrypt functionality
- neaten up classes and methods
