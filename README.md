Chitter Challenge
=================
# chitter-challenge

A twitter clone, my first complete web application as part of Makers Academy. This was a challenging and complex project, I have implemented tagging functionality in posts so users can tag other users which takes them to the user page.
The most difficult part was implementing a login feature which I have done manually. Once logged in, the user's homepage is redirected to a specific page where only they are able to make posts.
I am going to look into how to encrypt using Bcrypt

## How to use

```shell
bundle install
rackup
```

## Built with
- Ruby
- Rspec
- Sinatra
- PostgreSQL

## Still to add
Bcrypt functionality
neaten up classes and methods
